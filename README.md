## frontend and backend

You need to open up terminals for both the frontend and the backend, and run:

```sh
npm i
```

## backend

After you install the necessary modules then you need to run:

```sh
npx nodemon
```

## frontend

After the backend is running then you need to run:

```sh
npm run dev 
```

That will run the frontend. Then you need to open a new tab in your browser and type http://localhost:3000 (or click the link), that will bring you to the login page.
